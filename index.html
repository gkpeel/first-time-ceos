                <p> “As a first time attendee of the ScaleUp Summit I was wildly impressed. The speakers were incredible and having gone through building a business themselves, they really understood what the audience was trying to achieve. It was a great few days to reset and to reinspire - to take a step back from the day-to-day and to holistically focus on the organization and its direction.“</p>
